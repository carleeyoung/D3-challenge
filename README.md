# D3-challenge
2016 Census demographics were charted to show relationships between median household income, age, and poverty with healthcare, smoking and obesity for each state.  D3 coding was used to
create a dynamic chart to compare select parameters.  A tooltip was added to show detailed
information on each datapoint as you hover over the point.
